        <h1>Plants and Coffee</h1>
        <div class="posting-date">Tuesday, March 31, 2020</div>
        <p>
          When I think Plants and Coffee, I'm instantly reminded of my grandmother. She was one classy lady and she
          loved her houseplants almost as much as her afternoon coffee. Ritually, before making dinner my
          grandmother and my mom would sit together at the kitchen table and drink their afternoon coffee. It was with
          them that I had my first taste of coffee...I was only 3 years old! They indulged me that one time, (but
          really,
          they didn't know what hit them, it was a sneak attack and they didn't realize I had gulped down a whole cup
          until it was too late - mwahahaha) after that it was back to milk with a splash of coffee.</p>
        <p>If my grandmother kept her coffee close, she kept her plants even closer...like really close...like in the
          living room trailing up one wall and wrapped around the perimeter of the ceiling (what can I say, it was the
          80's). It was was important to keep the devil's vine (Epipremnum aureum) happy so it could continue taking
          over the house, and I have no idea where we got this idea but we used left over coffee grinds as plant
          fertilizer . Does this scientifically work? I have no idea. But I suppose the proof is in the pudding, and
          that plant grew unencumbered for years and years.</p>
        <p>SO don't throw out those grinds, your plants will love you for it!</p>
